              I have been developing and designing since before Dreamweaver was Adobe. I always did it on the side of my
              regular jobs so I never considered myself an official developer, until now. Coding Bootcamp has made me
              realize I have been a novice Full Stack Developer for a decade. I just never had any official structure or
              certification, hence no jobs in the industry other than start-ups and building WordPress sites as part of my
               IT firm's offerings. By the end of our Boot Camp, all of that will change! </p>
